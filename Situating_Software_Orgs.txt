StockX

1.) The software that StockX has made allows people to post items to sell  items at a desired asking price and for other individuals to buy items at a bidding price.

2.) This helps authenticate items and allows for buyers to find a more realistic selling price when compared to buying and item from someone on the street.

3.) StockX earns revenue from taking a percentage of the sales cost on the items that they facilitate the sale of.

4.) StockX is for buyers and sellers of collectable clothing and shoes.

5.) The more buyers and sellers that are matched, the more sales that StockX can take a percentage of.

6.) StockX's software automates the matching of buyers and sellers of collectible clothing items.

7.) The other organizations that offer similar value would be auction websites such as ebay.

8.) StockX's role in society is to make facilitating a sale of authenticated items faster by quickly pairing buyers and sellers of collectible clothing items.

Analysis:

1.) The outlook for StockX is good because of the added security that they add to transactions. It is hard to find comparable services that try to authenticate the legitimacy of products that are being bought and sold on their website.

2.) Not really, as it is a very niche market (mostly shoes) that only offers a small amount of value.
